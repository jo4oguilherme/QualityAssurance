## Introduction

In this repository, we focus on ensuring the quality of our project through comprehensive testing approaches. We employ a combination of automated and manual testing methods to identify and address potential issues in our application.

## Tools and Technologies

We utilize the following tools and technologies for our testing processes:

- **Postman**: Automating API testing and integration.
- **Cypress**: Automating end-to-end testing for web applications.
- **Manual Testing**: Performing hands-on testing to validate the user experience.

## Test Categories

Our tests are categorized as follows:

- **Postman**: API test cases are organized under the `postman` directory.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end test cases are structured in the `cypress` directory.
- **Manual Tests**: Manual test cases and scenarios can be found in the `manual_tests` directory.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance our test coverage in these categories.
